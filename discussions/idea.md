Catch Me If You Can

Very simple game.
You have a grid of circles. 
Those circles will have a different shade of a certain color every three seconds. 
Your job is to collect as many of the required color at once, without: 

a) Going a round with clicking anything.
a) Not clicking the right color, even once.
